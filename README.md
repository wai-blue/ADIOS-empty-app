# adios-app

This is an empty ADIOS application template to be used with ```composer create-project```.

You need only these simple commands to create **your first CRM application**:

```sh
composer create-project wai-blue/adios-app
cd adios-app
./bin/build.sh
```

This will create an ADIOS application based on the [simple-crm.json prototype](https://github.com/wai-blue/ADIOS/blob/main/docs/Prototype/examples/10-simple-crm.json) which you can further [customize](https://github.com/wai-blue/ADIOS/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md).
